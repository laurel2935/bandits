Here we consider an extension of the K-armed bandit problem to bandits with
an infinite number of arms.  In particular, we look at the Hierarchical
Optimistic Optimization ($\mathcal{X}$-armed)\cite{xarms08}
and Zooming \cite{kleinberg2008multi} algorithms, and
compare their behavior to that of a number of algorithms which merely
discretize the domain and run a standard finite-armed bandit algorithm.
