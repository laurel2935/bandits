% Sharp peak examples
\subsubsection{Sharply Peaking Reward Functions}
In general, problems where the reward function is sharply peaked in a
single neighborhood are difficult to handle. We wish to see how these
algorithms perform under these situations.

The bandit problem we're using to analyze this performance is
attempting to locate a specific point on the unit interval,
$\mathbf{p}$ where our reward is given by a Gaussian function of a
particular width.\\ For point $\mathbf{p}$ , the reward function is:
\[
	r_p(\mathbf{x}) = \exp{\frac{-(x-p)^2}{2\sigma}}
\]
Note that this reward function has value 1 when $\mathbf{x}
= \mathbf{p}$, and gets arbitrarily close to 0.  It gets increasingly
sharp as $\sigma$ increases.  We plot the $\mathcal{X}$-armed
algorithm against the discretized $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm in
\figref{fig:smoothness2}.

       mean-payoff functions of various smoothness.}
     \label{fig:smoothness2}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The Zooming Algorithm outperforms discretized $\epsilon$-greedy as
well.  For these graphs (\figref{fig:zoomebump} and
\figref{fig:zoombump2}), the Zooming Algorithm was restricted to
staying on the first phase, and the initial covering radius of each
arm was decreased to allow for a more reasonable initial covering.


\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \includegraphics[width=5 in]{figures/ZoomingEpsilonBump.png}
     \caption{The Zooming Algorithm will also eventually home in on the area of max reward, while discretization can simply miss it.}
     \label{fig:zoomebump}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=5 in]{figures/ZoomingBump.png}
     \caption{The zooming algorithm takes much longer to find the maximum for very narrow regions, as the radius of coverage decreases }
     \label{fig:zoombump2}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}



These figures show that while discretization algorithms may converge
faster, they lack the resolution in their coverage to detect narrowly
peaked maxima, while the algorithms that progressively refine their
coverage will eventually detect them.
